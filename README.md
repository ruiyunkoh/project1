# Activities for Pets and Pawrents

By: <b>Koh Rui Yun</b>

# 1. Project Summary
The project aims to build a website and an interactive map for Pawrents to explore pet-friendly facilities in Singapore. 
Due to the context of Singapore, there are limitations on the places and activities that pets can be involved in. Therefore, via the map element of this project, 
users may find activities suitable for their furkids. 
As each facility/place has been researched on and checked to ensure it is pet-friendly, it eliminates the uncertainties faced by Pawrents or unnecessary shock faced by passerbys, since every party is well aware of what to expect.

To sum it up, the project aims to promote inclusiveness of furkids in their Pawrent's activities.
